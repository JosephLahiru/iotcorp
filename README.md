### Business analysis (Phase 1)

Analyze the domain of the business environment to gain a complete understanding.
You must identify what the core business is and what exactly the value
sought/delivered to the customers. You must also study the existing business models
(the way of doing the business) and the business processors. It is very important to
identify who your customers, suppliers and their suppliers are and so on (supply chain)
and decide how you are going to reach your customers. How suppliers operate is also
as important as the business. As a part of the analysis, it is important to study the
environment to identify both the micro factors and macro forces.
You must start doing this from your customers. You will have to conduct some
interviews to identify the customers’ real requirements and rank the requirements as
well as identify the associations among them. A similar thing must be done for the
other stakeholders in seeking the requirements.

### Carryout a SWOT analysis. (Phase 2)

After identifying the business and the environment in which it operates, the next step
is to identify the opportunities out there for you. Then relate the opportunities with
the strengths you have and choose what opportunities to be used in your business.
Most importantly, you must prioritize the opportunities and decide which ones you
are going to take. You must not forget the weaknesses you have and how vulnerable
they make your business against the external threats of the business. Then decide how
to mitigate such vulnerabilities to be more immune.
It is also imperative to identify the core-competencies and distinct competencies the
business currently (if they are aware of such) resting on. This also will lead to
comprehensive analysis of industries underline profitability. In other words, answering
the question “where has the money gone?”

### Determine the strategic direction of the business. (Phase 3)

You have to develop the strategies to take the business to the intended directions.
Most of the time businessmen do not have a clear idea when you talk of new strategic
directions. Hence, try to be communicative on such issues. Your strategies must
generate greater value to customers of your business.

### Design an e-commerce model for the new business. (Phase 4)

Design an e-commerce model that is aligned with your strategic directions. Here, the
integration among the stakeholders (i.e suppliers, customers, partners, distributors,
etc) is very important. In other words, discuss how you are going to redesign your
business processors to work with your stakeholders in an integrated manner.
Remember, your design must bring win-win solutions to all the parties. You must focus
on both the frontend and backend of the business and the way the value to the
customer (both internal and external) can be enhanced. In this phase, your managerial
skills will come into play.

### Implement the design. (Phase 5)

Now it is time to lay down the plan for implementing your design and the expected
results. In this phase, your focus must be on systems integrations, web pages,
database designs, customer interactions, and customer trafficking are to name a few.
In this phase, your technical skills will significantly come into play.
Carry a post-implementation audit. (Phase 6)
Carry a post implementation audit to see the impact of the model to the operations
of the business. In this phase, you will have to carry small interviews with the
customers, suppliers and other business partners to get their views and feedback in
addition to looking at the financial records. You must not forget the internal
stakeholders of the business and to get their concerns as well.
